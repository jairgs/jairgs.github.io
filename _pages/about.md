I'm a data scientist with experience delivering end-to-end Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence projects since 2012.

Whether working independently as a consultant or as part of a team, I focus on delivering value through robust modeling and deployment strategies.

I've worked across various industries, including retail, consulting, technology, transportation, and industrials.

My portfolio includes projects in geospatial modeling, customer and store segmentation, demand and revenue forecasting, price optimization, A/B testing, churn prediction, natural language processing, audio and image classification, large language models, and deep neural networks.

I’m proficient in Python, R, SQL, cloud technologies, Kubernetes, Docker, Git, and more related technologies.

Currently, I’m focused on AI and agent systems.

Outside of work, I enjoy travel, photography, skating, skiing, fitness, and gaming.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
